This is a Python script that requests age, income, and ethnic demographic statistics of any census tract from the US Census API.
Certain parts are hardcoded (tract population, tract/county/state codes).
You must have a valid Census API key to request data.

This project uses data from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Decennial Census and 2023 American Community Survey (ACS) via the public Census API.
The Census Bureau is not responsible for the analyses or interpretations presented here.
